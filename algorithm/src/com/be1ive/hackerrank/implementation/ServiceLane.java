 *
 * Problem Statement
 *
 * Calvin is driving his favorite vehicle on the 101 freeway.
 * He notices that the check engine light of his vehicle is on, and he wants to service it immediately to avoid any risks.
 * Luckily, a service lane runs parallel to the highway. The length of the highway and the service lane is N units.
 * The service lane consists of N segments of unit length, where each segment can have different widths.
 * Calvin can enter into and exit from any segment. Let's call the entry segment as index i and the exit segment as index j.
 * Assume that the exit segment lies after the entry segment(j>i) and i â‰¥ 0. Calvin has to pass through all segments from index i to indexj (both inclusive).
 * Paradise Highway
 * Calvin has three types of vehicles - bike, car and truck, represented by 1, 2 and 3 respectively.
 * These numbers also denote the width of the vehicle. We are given an array width[] of length N, where width[k] represents the width of kth segment of our service lane.
 * It is guaranteed that while servicing he can pass through at most 1000 segments, including entry and exit segments.
 * If width[k] is 1, only the bike can pass through kth segment.
 * If width[k] is 2, the bike and car can pass through kth segment.
 * If width[k] is 3, any of the bike, car or truck can pass through kth segment.
 * Given the entry and exit point of Calvin's vehicle in the service lane, output the type of largest vehicle which can pass through the service lane (including the entry & exit segment)
 *
 * Input Format
 * The first line of input contains two integers - N & T, where N is the length of the freeway, and T is the number of test cases.
 * The next line has N space-separated integers which represents the width array.
 *
 * T test cases follow. Each test case contains two integers - i & j, where i is the index of segment through which Calvin enters the service lane and j is the index of the lane segment where he exits.
 *
 * Output Format
 * For each test case, print the number that represents the largest vehicle type that can pass through the service lane.
 *
 * Note
 * Calvin has to pass through all segments from index i to indexj (both inclusive).
 *
 * Constraints
 * 2 <= N <= 100000
 * 1 <= T <= 1000
 * 0 <= i < j < N
 * 2 <= j-i+1 <= min(N,1000)
 * 1 <= width[k] <= 3, where 0 <= k < N
